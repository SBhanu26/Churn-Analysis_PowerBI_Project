Customer Churn Analysis

Project Overview : 

Customer churn is a critical business problem where customers stop using a company’s services.
This project analyzes telecom customer churn data to identify key factors influencing churn and to quantify its revenue impact, helping businesses improve retention strategies.

The analysis combines data exploration, visual analytics, and business insights using Python and Power BI.

Objectives

• Understand customer behavior patterns leading to churn

• Identify high-risk churn segments

• Analyze revenue impact of churn vs retained customers

• Provide actionable insights for business decision-making

Dataset

Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset

File: WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

Key Features:

• Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen, tenure)

• Service details (Internet, phone, streaming services)

• Billing & payment information

• Monthly & total charges

Churn status (Yes / No)

Tools & Technologies

• Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

• Power BI Desktop

• DAX (Measures & Calculations)

• CSV Dataset

Analysis Performed
1️ Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

• Univariate analysis (distribution of tenure, charges)

• Bivariate analysis (churn vs tenure, churn vs charges)

• Multivariate analysis (churn by contract type, payment method)

• Correlation analysis

2️ Churn Risk Analysis

• Identified churn concentration by:

• Contract type

• Payment method

• Tenure groups

• Monthly charges

3️ Revenue Impact Analysis

• Monthly revenue from retained customers

• Monthly revenue loss from churned customers

• Comparison using Waterfall & Bar Charts

4️ Power BI Dashboard

• KPI cards (Total Customers, Churn Rate, Revenue Lost)

• Churn distribution visuals

• Revenue impact visuals

• Interactive filters & slicers

 Key Insights

• Customers on month-to-month contracts churn significantly more

• Low tenure customers show the highest churn risk

• Electronic check payment users churn more than others

• Churn leads to substantial recurring revenue loss

• Retaining even a small percentage of high-risk customers can improve revenue significantly

• PBIX Dashboard

How to Run

• Load the CSV file into Python or Power BI

• Perform EDA using Python (optional)

• Open Churn_Analysis.pbix in Power BI Desktop

• Refresh data & explore dashboards
